## New Proposal
We decided to to focus in fully connected parts of trained networks.

- We will choose fully connected parts of following networks and write c code to read them into various C formats.
- We need to write code fore doing basic feed forward capability.
- Simulating pruning and comparing it with normal pruning(if you have time). You can compare different simulations and see how pruning statistics effect performance.
